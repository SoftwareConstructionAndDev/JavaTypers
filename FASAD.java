Implementing the Facade pattern in your existing project requires adding some new files to encapsulate the complexities of interactions among your presentation layer, business logic layer, and data access layer. Here's a breakdown of what files you might need to add or modify to effectively implement the Facade pattern:

 1. Facade Interface and Implementation
Create an interface and its implementation to act as the Facade. This will help in achieving a decoupled architecture where high-level modules like your GUI (Presentation Layer) interact with a simplified interface that manages all underlying operations.

 Files to Add:

- FileManagerFacade.java (Interface)
  - Defines the high-level functions that the presentation layer will use.

- FileManagerFacadeImpl.java (Implementation)
  - Implements the operations defined in FileManagerFacade, bridging the communication between the presentation layer and business logic/data access layers.

 2. Modified Files
Modify some existing files to use the Facade pattern effectively. This modification ensures that the GUI interacts only with the facade rather than directly calling the business logic or data access methods.

Files to Modify:

- TextEditorGUI.java (Presentation Layer)
  - Modify this GUI class to use the FileManagerFacade for all operations like fetching files, updating, deleting, etc., instead of directly interacting with FileBL or FileDAO.

 3. Abstract Factory (Optional but Recommended)
If you choose to implement an Abstract Factory pattern to manage the creation of DAOs, which supports the Facade's operation seamlessly, especially when dealing with multiple data sources or different database implementations:

Files to Add:

- DAOFactory.java
  - A factory class that abstracts the instantiation of DAO objects, making it easier to switch between different data access implementations based on configuration or environment.

 Example Code for the Facade Interface and Implementation
Hereâ€™s an example of what the Facade interface and its implementation might look like:

 FileManagerFacade.java
java
package BL;

import DTO.FileDTO;
import DTO.PageDTO;

import java.util.List;

public interface FileManagerFacade {
    PageDTO<FileDTO> getPageOfFiles(int page, int size);
    boolean createFile(FileDTO fileDTO);
    boolean updateFile(FileDTO fileDTO);
    boolean deleteFile(String fileName);
    FileDTO readFile(String fileName);
}


FileManagerFacadeImpl.java
java
package BL;

import DTO.FileDTO;
import DTO.PageDTO;
import DAL.IFileDAO;

public class FileManagerFacadeImpl implements FileManagerFacade {
    private FileBL fileBL;

    public FileManagerFacadeImpl(FileBL fileBL) {
        this.fileBL = fileBL;
    }

    @Override
    public PageDTO<FileDTO> getPageOfFiles(int page, int size) {
        return fileBL.getPageOfFiles(page, size);
    }

    @Override
    public boolean createFile(FileDTO fileDTO) {
        return fileBL.createFile(fileDTO);
    }

    @Override
    public boolean updateFile(FileDTO fileDTO) {
        return fileBL.updateFile(fileDTO);
    }

    @Override
    public boolean deleteFile(String fileName) {
        return fileBL.deleteFile(fileName);
    }

    @Override
    public FileDTO readFile(String fileName) {
        return fileBL.readFile(fileName);
    }
}


Conclusion
With these additions and modifications, your application will have a clean separation of concerns where the GUI doesn't need to know about the underlying complexities of data operations, adhering to both the Facade and Dependency Inversion principles. This structure will also simplify unit testing and maintenance of your application.
